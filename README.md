# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

Hello! My name is Elise Jang, and my pronouns are she/her! I am going into my last quarter at UCI and was looking for a fun class to end off my Computer Science journey. Initially, I joined computer science with more of an interest in creating apps over games, but I've been playing more games like Dress to Impress on ROBLOX or mobile games like Brawl Star or Cat Snack Bar, which has increased my interest to apply my knowledge in that side! I don't have any expereince with game development, but I would really like to have this be a true introduction to the programming side of games. I hope to make a game that is similar to cat snack bar or something that builds, cooks, or grows. 

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [*] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I am hoping to get a game that I can add to my profile not just from a class project, but one that I feel confident enough to make outside of class in my free time. I want to better my relationship with coding outside of class!

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
I don't consider myself a gamer, so I am nervous that I won't have much to relate to with the people in my class or groups. Also, nervous that I won't understand certain words or situations that people are already familiar with.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Swift

2. Game development (any engine)
N/A

3. Unity
N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
N/A but guess is that you write requirements that encompass the purpose of the game and aesthetics?

2. Scope management
N/A

3. Iteration
Repeating the same thing over and over until you have to stop.

4. Object-Oriented programming
Programming that works with objects or containers. Items like lists, dictionaries, classes are common through OOP.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
Not too familiar, but my best guess is that it's something similar to a storyboard, which is used in Swift?

## Complete!
